Feature: Plumbus
  I always wondered how, uh, plumbuses got made

  Background:
    Given everyone has a plumbus in their home

  Scenario: How they do it

    Given first they take the dinglebop
      And they smooth it out with a bunch of schleem
      And the schleem is then repurposed for later batches

    Then they take the dinglebop
      And they push it through the grumbo where the fleeb is rubbed against it

    Given It is important that the fleeb is rubbed because the fleeb has all of the fleeb juice

    Then a schlami shows up
      And he rubs it
      And spits on it

    Then they cut the fleeb
      Given there are several hizzards in the way

    Then the blamfs rub against the chumbles
      And the ploobis and grumbo are shaved away

    Then that leaves you with a regular old plumbus
